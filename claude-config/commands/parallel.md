# Parallel Execution Command

I'll analyze the task "$ARGUMENTS" and determine if it can benefit from parallel execution using sub-agents.

## Parallelization Analysis

### Task Assessment
- **Task Type**: [Analysis of the task nature]
- **Complexity**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]
- **Dependencies**: [Identify task dependencies]
- **Parallelizable Components**: [Parts that can run concurrently]

### Parallel Execution Plan

#### Sub-Agent Distribution
1. **Agent 1**: [Task description and files]
2. **Agent 2**: [Task description and files]
3. **Agent 3**: [Task description and files]
4. **Agent 4**: [Task description and files]

#### Coordination Strategy
- **Execution Order**: [Sequential dependencies]
- **Shared Resources**: [Files/data that need coordination]
- **Communication**: [How agents will coordinate]
- **Merge Strategy**: [How results will be combined]

#### Progress Tracking
- **Individual Progress**: Real-time updates from each agent
- **Milestone Checkpoints**: Key completion points
- **Error Handling**: How to handle failures in parallel tasks
- **Rollback Plan**: Strategy if parallel execution fails

### Benefits of Parallel Execution
- **Time Savings**: Estimated time reduction
- **Resource Utilization**: Better use of available resources
- **Scalability**: Ability to handle larger tasks
- **Quality**: Multiple focused agents on specific areas

### Risks & Mitigation
- **Merge Conflicts**: Strategy for handling conflicts
- **Dependencies**: Managing task dependencies
- **Quality Control**: Ensuring consistency across agents
- **Error Propagation**: Preventing cascade failures

## Execution Options

**Option 1: Sequential Execution** (Traditional)
- Single agent handles entire task
- Predictable execution flow
- Easier debugging and rollback

**Option 2: Parallel Execution** (Recommended for large tasks)
- Multiple agents work simultaneously
- Faster completion for complex tasks
- Better resource utilization

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Mix of parallel and sequential execution
- Parallel for independent components
- Sequential for dependent operations

Would you like me to proceed with parallel execution, or would you prefer a different approach?

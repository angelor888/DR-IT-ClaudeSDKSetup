# Session Summary - July 8, 2025

## Overview

Continued from previous session with complete MCP ecosystem expansion and Claude Code workflow configuration. Today focused on OAuth setup, testing, and creating a Jobber quote.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. OAuth Configuration ✅
Successfully configured OAuth for 8/12 services:
- ✅ GitHub (using personal access token)
- ✅ Google Services (Gmail, Drive, Docs)
- ✅ SendGrid
- ✅ QuickBooks
- ✅ Slack
- ✅ Airtable
- ✅ Jobber
- ⏳ Notion (needs when required)
- ⏳ OpenAI (needs when required)
- ⏳ Matterport (needs when required)
- ⏳ Firebase (needs when required)

### 2. Key Discoveries

#### Jobber OAuth
- **Major Discovery:** Jobber automatically supports localhost redirect URIs
- No need for HTTPS or public URLs
- Simple flow: `http://localhost:8080/callback` works perfectly
- Created `jobber-oauth-flow.py` script for easy token generation

#### QuickBooks OAuth
- Requires HTTPS redirect URIs (no localhost support)
- Solution: Use OAuth Playground at https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/playground
- Successfully obtained tokens through playground

#### Slack Token Fix
- Identified and fixed incorrect token in environment file
- Updated with correct working token in environment configuration

### 3. Scripts Created

1. **oauth-setup.sh** - Interactive OAuth token configuration
2. **jobber-oauth-flow.py** - Jobber OAuth flow handler
3. **quickbooks-oauth-playground.py** - Instructions for QuickBooks
4. **test-all-services.sh** - Comprehensive service testing
5. **validate-oauth-tokens.sh** - Token validation script

### 4. Jobber Quote Creation ✅

Successfully created Quote #1157 with:
- Client: Kathleen Ohm
- 3 line items totaling $1,500
- Key learning: `saveToProductsAndServices` field is required for each line item

### 5. Documentation Created

- OAUTH-SETUP-GUIDE.md
- OAUTH-FINAL-REPORT.md
- QUICKBOOKS-OAUTH-PLAYGROUND.md
- JOBBER-QUOTE-CREATION-LEARNING.md
- Updated CLAUDE.md with complete context

## Current State

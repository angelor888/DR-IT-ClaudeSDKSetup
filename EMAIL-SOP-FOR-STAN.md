### 📚 **Documentation & Access**

**Complete SOP Document:** `DR-SOP-MCP-ECOSYSTEM-EXPANSION-v1.0-20250708.md`  
**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/angelor888/DR-IT-ClaudeSDKSetup  
**Slack Canvas:** Available in #sop-library channel (Canvas ID: F094UDHQKAS)  

The SOP includes:
- Installation procedures for all 27 servers
- Custom server development patterns  
- Authentication framework setup
- Testing and validation procedures
- Business workflow examples
- Troubleshooting guidelines

### 🎯 **Next Steps**

**High Priority:**
1. Authentication setup for Google Services, Business Tools, Financial systems
2. SOP automation workflow implementation  
3. Team training on new MCP capabilities

**Ready for Implementation:**
- Client onboarding automation
- Project management integration

This represents a major milestone in our business automation capabilities. We now have a unified AI interface that can manage the complete business lifecycle - from initial lead generation through final payment processing.

The full SOP provides step-by-step procedures for replicating this entire ecosystem, making it valuable for training, documentation, and future system expansions.

Let me know if you'd like to schedule a walkthrough of the new capabilities or if you have any questions about the implementation.
